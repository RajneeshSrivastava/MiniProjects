#Pipeline to analyse RNA sequencing data 
STEP A: Download the raw RNA sequencing data (FASTQ files) in local directory

STEP B: Analyse the quality and statistics of reads using FASTQC-toolkits. 

[Optional: The software should be installed in local machine or cluster and can be accesed by using following command]
		
module load java/1.7.0_25   
module load fastqc/0.10.1
fastqc -o /Out_Dir/ -f fastq /Sample.fastq 	      
# where Sample = fastq samples provided

STEP C: Do reads manipulation as per statistics for each FASTQ samples using FASTX-Toolkit 

[Optional: The software should be installed in local machine or cluster and can be accesed by using following command]:
		
module load fastx/0.0.13 (in Karst)
fastx_trimmer -Q 33 -f 3 -l 73 -i Sample.fastq -o Sample_T.fastq		
As an example - Here only 3rd (by -f) to 73rd (by -l) bases were kept.  

# In order to exclude the bases with low phred score, trimming of the reads was done. 
fastq_quality_filter -Q 33 -q 30 -i Sample_T.fastq -o Sample_q30.fastq		
# For instance - Here reads with average phred score <30 were filtered out

STEP D: Align the high quality sequencing reads (from STEP C) onto human reference genome (hg38)
using Hisat (installed? Must be Yes).
This step includes two sub-steps:

  1. Building up the indexes for reference genome
	
hisat-build -f /Human/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.84.dna.toplevel.fa /Human/h38.84/h38.84
    
    # Refernce genome (and .gtf file for annotation) for human was downloaded from Ensembl using following command:
    wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-84/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa.gz
    NOTE: This step is required just once to index the genome build and can be used in next step directly	
	
  2. Alignment:
  
hisat -p 32 -q -x /Human/h38.84/h38.84 -1 Rep1_1.fastq -2 Rep1_2.fastq -S /Output/Rep1.sam

STEP E: Use samtools (check the module availability) for post processing of the aligned reads

samtools view -bS /Output/Rep1.sam > /Output/Rep1.bam     # data compression
samtools sort /Output/Rep1.bam /Output/Rep1.sorted        # sorting
samtools index /Output/Rep1.sorted.bam                    # indexing the bam

STEP F: Quantification for processed reads using StringTie (Check for module availability)

stringtie /Output/Rep1.sorted.bam -p 32 -G /Human/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.84.gtf -o /Output/Rep1.gtf -A /Output/Rep1.tab
  	# .gtf file contains the quantified transcriptome .tab file provides the gene level expression
	
Note: This pipeline quantifies the annotated as well as novel genes (having prefix "STRG."). Flagging "e" in above command   
restrict the assembly to annotated genes/ transcripts

STEP G: Get the gene level expression of the samples in tab.  

##After preprocessing of the reads, below code can be executed in bigred - for instance Sample Run for Rep1 in bigred
