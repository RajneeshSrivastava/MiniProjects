**Publication:** Methods. 2019 Sep 5. pii: S1046-2023(19)30111-2. doi: 10.1016/j.ymeth.2019.09.004.

#### This database facilitates a collection of 4.8 millions of sgRNA targeting all possible binding sites of RNA Binding Proteins documented in ENCODE project.

**Figure 2.** (A) Heatmap showing the number of unique binding sites (log10 transformed -red) and sgRNAs (log10 transformedblue) and the ratio of the number of sgRNAs and binding sites (green) for each RBP, representing an estimated average sgRNAs
designed per binding site for each RBP in both the cell lines (H-HepG2 and K-K562). RBPs for which currently no binding site
information is available from ENCODE project for either cell line are greyed out. (B) Distribution of the total number of designed
sgRNAs available from SliceIt as a function of the predicted efficiency and specificity scores. (C) Density plot showing the
distribution of distances between sgRNAâ€™s PAM location and the mid-point of the targeted binding site, for all the sgRNAs
available from SliceIt. (D) Distribution of the absolute number of sgRNAs across human chromosomes present in SliceIt.
