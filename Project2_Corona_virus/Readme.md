## Analysis of the 2019-nCoV (Corona virus) genome

This is a #dailycoding project. Here I analyzed the genome of 2019-nCoV, a deadly ssRNA virus identified for
epidemic respiratory illness (mainly in China). I downloaded its 29.8 kb genome from NCBI and analyzed
its base composition. I observed that the GC-content of this viral genome was 38%, and generally high (~50%)
at both the ends. This analysis suggest that this virus genome exhibit more stable secondary structure at the
ends than central region (with lower GC content). .
