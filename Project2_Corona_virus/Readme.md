This is a general purpose script for handling fasta file. Here i am using 2019nCoV (Corona Virus) genome, released on Jan26, 2020.

Here is the basic stats of #Coronavirus genome (MT020881_1, 29.8kb). The sequence is downloaded from NCBI (Note: It is a ssRNA virus).
I observed that the GC-content of this virus genome is 38% however it is generally high at beginning and the end of the genome. It is possible that the ends of this viral genome (with higher GC content) have more stable secondary structures than central region (with lower GC content).
